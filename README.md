# Monorepo

This is a monorepo sample repository using turborpo

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `bff`: a [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) api
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Listing dependecies

```sh
pnpm list --filter './apps/**'
```

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd monorepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd monorepo
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching


Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd monorepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```

## Why PNPM?

This project uses PNPM because it is highly efficient for monorepos:

- **Disk Space Efficiency**: Dependencies are stored globally and symlinked, avoiding duplication.
- **Faster Installations**: Optimized for speed with content-addressable storage.
- **Strict Dependency Isolation**: Ensures each package only accesses its declared dependencies.
- **Native Monorepo Support**: Seamlessly links packages with `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- **Perfect for Turborepo**: Complements Turborepo's caching and task orchestration for faster builds.
